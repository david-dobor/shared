    "A useful property of classes is that we can have hierarchies of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many types have properties in common with other types. For example, rabits, cats and humans are kinds of animals, and they share certain animal-like behaviors. For example, the ability to move or to emit a sound is a behavior that is shared among all these animals. These behaviors of course vary from one kind of an animal to another - while bears roar, cats mewow - but the ability to make some sound is common. \n",
    " \n",
    "The different kinds of animals might also share common attributes. For example, `age` might be an attribute that every animal has, whether it's a human or a rabbit. \n",
    "\n",
    "We want to develop a type for each kind of animal - one for a human, one for a rabbit, etc. But we want to abstract away the behaviors and attributes that are common to all animals into a single class. This class, which we'll call the `Animal` class, will be a *superclass* to these related types. The types `Human`, `Cat`, etc., will inherit certain bahaviors and attributes from the `Animal` class, and we'll call these types *subclasses* of the `Animal` class. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each subclass will then add a certain twist to the shared animal-like behavior. For example the `Human` subclass of the `Animal` superclass will have the ability to speak, which is a particular way of emiting sounds; cats will have the ability to meow, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "What we've just described is an example of **inheritance**, and it provides a convenient mechanism for for building groups of related abstractions. \n",

    "Let's define a new type (class) that represents a number as a fraction. To get things started, we'll have to decide what are the data attributes we need to include in the class (i.e., what's the internal representation of the class) and what are the methods that can be used to interact with the instances of the class (i.e., what's the interface of the class).\n",
    "\n",
    "As for the *attributes*, we need the numerator and the denominator (i.e., the internal representation will be two integers). As for the *interface*, we might want to think about things like how to add or subtract two fractions, how to convert `fraction`s to `float`s, may be even having a nice `print` representation of the `fraction`.\n",
